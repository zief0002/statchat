This StatChat is cancelled. 

`#FlattenTheCurve` `#SocialDistancing` `#DoingOurPart`

<!-- - **6:00&ndash;6:30 Settle In &amp; Eat** -->

<!-- - **6:30&ndash;7:45 Guest Speaker:** [Matt Beckman](https://mdbeckman.github.io/) from the Statistics Department at Penn State will discuss Implementing version control as a learning objective in statistics courses.<br /> -->

<!--   *Title:* Implementing version control as a learning objective in statistics courses using Git/Github -->

<!--   *Abstract:* -->
<!--   Version control tools (e.g. Git/GitHub) are integral to a reproducible workflow. There are many resources out there for learning Git/Github, but most are written for people with more technical experience. How can we onboard students efficiently? How can we help students avoid common problems? This session intends to (1) introduce the audience to version control principles, (2) make a case for version control as a substantive learning objective in teaching/training statisticians and analysts, and (3) share resources and engage participants in implementation details to begin integrating Git/GitHub as a meaningful part of a statistics course. We will discuss an implementation model suitable for both technical and non-technical students without prior experience needed.  We also discuss GitHub Classroom as a means to preserve academic integrity while still providing students real experience with tools designed to facilitate collaboration and code sharing. The session includes hands-on experiences with methods to first introduce GitHub to students, to streamline Git &amp; RStudio linkage, and to use GitHub Classroom to distribute assignments that include instructions, starter code, and data. -->

<!-- - **7:45&ndash;8:00:** Discussion, wrap-up, and next StatChat (We need to pick  place to have our first ever StatChat social.) -->

<!-- We hope to see you there!  If you plan to attend, [please RSVP by signing up to bring food or beverage to share](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y09XZuKQyMPYnLZKgNV8cs2Bu3wY6Vr-Q1ZvM_8lUpE/edit#gid=0).  And please spread the word among any colleagues that may be interested in the night's topics. -->

## Upcoming Meeting: May 06, 2020 (StatChat Social)

The May StatChat will be Wedesday May 06, 2020 from 6:00--8:00pm at the [Acadia Cafe](http://acadiapub.com/) (329 Cedar Avenue). There is no formal program, instead this meeting is a StatChat social. Come enjoy some food and beverage debrief and celebrate our semesters. Rumor is that there might also be some pub trivia.
