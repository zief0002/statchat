## Upcoming Meeting: October 30, 2019 Meeting

Our next StatChat is Wednesday October 30, 2019 from 6:00--8:00pm at Macalester College (Olin-Rice 250). The agenda for the meeting will include:

- **6:00&ndash;6:30 Settle In &amp; Eat**

- **6:30&ndash;7:45 Guest Speaker:** [Kris Gorman](https://cei.umn.edu/staff/kris-gorman) from the *Center for Educational Innovation* at the University of Minnesota will discuss the nebulous balance between breadth and depth in statistics education.<br />

  *Abstract:*
  In order to help students retain information long term and transfer that knowledge to new situations, there's research to suggest that rather than cover everything (i.e. provide full breadth), it's better to cover some things more thoroughly (i.e. provide depth).  Kris Gorman will share findings about depth vs breadth and a few examples of how instructors at UMN have altered courses to incorporate more depth.  There will be time for discussion about what this might mean for choices in our own teaching. 

- **7:45&ndash;8:00:** Discussion, wrap-up, and next StatChat (We need to pick  place to have our first ever StatChat social.)

We hope to see you there!  If you plan to attend, [please RSVP by signing up to bring food or beverage to share](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y09XZuKQyMPYnLZKgNV8cs2Bu3wY6Vr-Q1ZvM_8lUpE/edit#gid=0).  And please spread the word among any colleagues that may be interested in the night's topics.
